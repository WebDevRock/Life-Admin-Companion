## Database Schema

### `sessions` (auth, managed by replit-auth)
Session storage for Replit Auth.

### `users` (auth, managed by replit-auth)
Stores user profiles from Replit OIDC (id, email, firstName, lastName, profileImageUrl).

### `life_admin_items`
Core table. Every row is scoped by `user_id`.
- id, userId, title, category, provider, referenceNumber
- status: active | completed | renewed | cancelled | archived
- dueDate, renewalDate, reminderDate
- costAmount, costFrequency: one-off | weekly | monthly | quarterly | annually | unknown
- notes, usefulLink
- priority: low | normal | high
- createdAt, updatedAt

## Recurring Items

Items can be set as recurring with a frequency of weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually.

When a recurring item's status is set to **"renewed"** via the PUT `/api/items/:id` endpoint, the server automatically creates a new active item with:
- All the same fields (title, category, provider, cost, notes, etc.)
- Due date, renewal date, and reminder date all advanced by the recurrence interval
- Status set to "active"
- `isRecurring: true` and the same `recurrenceFrequency`

The original item is kept in "renewed" status. The new item appears in the items list and dashboard immediately.

The recurring section in the item form shows a toggle and — when enabled — a frequency picker. A "Repeats {frequency}" badge appears in the items list and detail view. The detail view also shows an explanatory card about the auto-create behaviour.

## Notifications

### In-app reminder bell
A bell icon sits in the navbar (visible when logged in). It fetches your active items via React Query and filters client-side for any item whose `reminderDate` is today or in the past. A red badge shows the count. Clicking opens a dropdown listing each due item — tap any to go to its detail page.

### Email reminders (requires SMTP setup)
The API server runs a daily cron job at **08:00 UTC** that:
1. Finds all active items with `reminderDate ≤ today`
2. Groups them by user, skipping any user+item combinations already emailed today (tracked in `reminder_email_log` table)
3. Looks up each user's email from `usersTable`
4. Sends a styled HTML digest email via SMTP

**To enable email reminders, set these environment secrets:**
| Secret | Example |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` |
| `SMTP_USER` | `you@gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Gmail app password |
| `FROM_EMAIL` | `you@gmail.com` |
| `APP_URL` | Your deployed URL (for the "View your items →" button) |

If none of these are set, the job logs a single info message on startup and does nothing — it won't crash.

For Gmail: create an App Password at myaccount.google.com → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords.

## Notes

- All queries are scoped by `user_id` — users only see their own data
- Items can be archived (status = "archived") instead of deleted
- No email/push notifications — reminders are shown inside the dashboard
- Notes and links are stored as text; no file uploads in MVP
- Recurring item auto-creation happens server-side in the PUT route — no client-side logic needed
